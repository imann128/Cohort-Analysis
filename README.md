Cohort Analysis Project
Overview
This project conducts a cohort analysis on a SaaS sales funnel using the cohorts.csv dataset. It tracks lead progression across stages (lead → phase 2 → phase 3 → closed), calculates conversion rates, and measures average time to close deals, providing insights to optimize sales strategies.
Key Features

Cohort Grouping: Groups leads by entry month to track progression over time.
Conversion Rates: Calculates conversion rates for each stage in the funnel.
Time Analysis: Measures average days to close deals per cohort.
Insights: Identifies trends like declining conversion rates and faster closures in later cohorts.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and cohort analysis.
Google Colab: Environment for running the notebook.

How to Use

Open Cohort_Analysis.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Download and unzip the dataset (cohorts.zip) to access cohorts.csv.
Place the unzipped .csv file in the same directory as the notebook.
Run the notebook cells to group leads, calculate metrics, and analyze trends.
Review the output tables for conversion rates and time-to-close insights.

Dataset

Source: cohorts.zip (included in the repository).
Note: The dataset (cohorts.csv) is compressed into a .zip file due to its large size. Please unzip it before running the notebook.
Contains SaaS lead data with timestamps for each stage in the sales funnel.

Results
Key findings include a decline in conversion rates (e.g., 63-65% in 2015 vs. 1.1% in June 2016) and faster deal closures in later cohorts (e.g., 6.5 days), offering actionable insights for sales funnel optimization.

Project completed as part of my ecommerce analytics portfolio.
